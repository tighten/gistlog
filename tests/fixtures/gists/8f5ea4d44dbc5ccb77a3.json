      "content": "The end goal was to order a query by a list of specific values for a column, but then also order those by a created_at date in ascending order and then by id in ascending order\n\nThis proved to be more of a challenge than I originally thought. The solution I came up with is as follows.\n\n```SQL\nSELECT id, clientId, created_at \nFROM `claims` \nWHERE `clientId` IN ('FOO', 'BAR', 'BAZ', 'FIZZ') \nORDER BY clientId = 'FIZZ', clientId = 'BAZ', clientId = 'BAR', clientId = 'FOO', \ncreated_at ASC, id ASC\n```\n\nDirect your attention to line 4. Looking at this, you might assume that the returned order of the results would be `FIZZ, BAZ, BAR, FOO` but in fact, you would be wrong.\n\nWhile normally the order by statements seem to stack on top of the previous order statement, in appears that when using an `=` to define the order, the orders stack in reverse.\n\nThat is, the last order by statement containing the `=` was the first result returned. It's the little things."
