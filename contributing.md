## Contributing

We welcome contributions! We ask you to follow a few guidelines when making a contribution:

- [Follow PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)
- Four spaces for indentation
- Alphabetize CSS property names

### Branching

When making a pull request, please code your feature on a feature branch.

```command-line
    feature/feature-name
```

When you are ready, tag @stauffermatt for a review. Your code needs to be tested with PHPUnit prior to making the pull
request. To run the PHPUnit suite on your tests run

```command-line
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

If you are looking for something to contribute, please look at our issues. There you can post ideas, pick up features others have requested, or help another developer in need of some guidance.

Happy coding!
