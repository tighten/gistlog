Turn your gists into easy, beautiful, responsive blog posts--a "Gistlog". Just paste a Gist URL into [Gistlog.co](https://gistlog.co/) and you're up and running.

You can also just replace `gist.github.com` in any URL with `gistlog.co`, and you instantly have a beautiful Gistlog.

An exercise in iterative development by [Matt Stauffer](http://mattstauffer.co/) and [Adam Wathan](http://adamwathan.me/) of [Tighten Co.](http://tighten.co/).
